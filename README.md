different types of probability distributions

DIFF TYPES OF PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION 

Uniform Distribution (Uniform): In this distribution, all outcomes have equal probability. It's commonly represented as a straight horizontal line in a probability density function (PDF) plot.

Exponential Distribution (Exponential): This distribution models the time between events in a Poisson process, which is a process with a constant average rate. It's often used to model the time between occurrences of rare events.

Normal Distribution (Gaussian): Also known as the bell curve, this is one of the most common distributions. It's characterized by its symmetric shape and is often used to model real-world phenomena due to the Central Limit Theorem. It's parametrized by its mean and standard deviation.

Binomial Distribution (Binomial): This distribution models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials, where each trial has a constant probability of success. It's often used to model situations with two possible outcomes (success or failure).

Poisson Distribution (Poisson): This distribution models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, given a constant average rate of occurrence. It's commonly used to model rare events.
